Education Connect Postmortem. 

Summary
Duration: On Friday 19th May 2023 at 10:00AM – 11:00AM (EAT) Website shut down.
All students and school administrators requesting access were locked out. Leading to having an unstable communication thus disrupting flow of information.

Timeline
10:00AM: The issue was detected by a student and reported to an administrator
10:05AM: The administrator tried to access the site but was locked out.
10:08AM: The administrator reported the issue to our IT team
10:10AM:  The IT team started investigating the problem and work out on the possible solutions
10:25AM: Dissatisfied clients started calling asking about the website being down.
10:45AM: The IT team found the root cause of the problem and worked on it.
11:00AM: The website was up and running.

Root Cause and Resolution
The IT team deduced that the problem was caused by some files being corrupt thus making the website being unable to fully launch. They repaired the corrupt files that could be and used the backup to get the backed up the uncorrupted files.

Corrective and Preventive Measures
•	All servers and sites should have error logging turned on to easily identify errors if anything goes wrong.
•	All servers and sites should be tested locally before deploying on a multi-server setup this will result in correcting errors before going live resulting in less fixing time if site goes down.

Conclusion
Corruption always brings everything down be it in the digital world or the physical world. Too bad we don’t have anti-corruption officials in the digital world, all this would have been avoided.
